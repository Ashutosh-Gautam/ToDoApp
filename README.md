## ðŸš€ Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
*   Android Studio
*   Java JDK

## ðŸ“ƒ Libraries used
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - First class and official programming language for Android development.
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - For asynchronous and more..
- [SQLite](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/sqlite) - SQLite object mapping library.
- [RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/recyclerview) - Display large sets of data in your UI while minimizing memory usage.
- [Material Components for Android](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android) - Modular and customizable Material Design UI components for Android.
- [ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) - Generates a binding class for each XML layout file present in that module and allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
- [Pagination](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-overview) - The Paging library helps you load and display pages of data from a larger dataset from local storage or over a network.
- [SQLite Testing](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/testing-db#android) - The recommended approach for testing your database implementation is writing a JUnit test that runs on an Android device. Because these tests don't require creating an activity, they should be faster to execute than your UI tests..
